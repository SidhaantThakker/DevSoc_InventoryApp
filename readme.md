Team Members:

What we learnt:
Using NodeJS, Express and MongoDB to build a full-stack application, using ejs to render pages dynamically and building a server.

Using the App:
ProdBox can be used to add, remove update and search for products. 
Products can ba assigned to sections, which once created, show all the products under them.
Employee Data can also be stored, updated and deleted on the app.

Future Update Ideas:
Add more fields to products, add more features to manage, add better linking across the various facets of the app, add a login system.
